# Project_Primer_design_SCARESCROW
"""
This script creates forward and reverse primers for targeted genes from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. All you need to do is edit or adapt the cDNA.py file. Any gene inserted as a library type should work and the system will then give the ideal recommended primers / or if there are none, than the non-recommended primers with the respective melting temperature.
